			Apache2::RequestRec::Time
		-----------------------------------------

This is the README file for the Apache2::RequestRec::Time module.

As of mod_perl 2.0.4, it is possible to get request duration
information by substracting current time from $r->request_time().
However, that information is in seconds, so it's not possible to get
the equivalent of Custom Log Format %D -- the time taken to serve
the request, in microseconds.

This module adds $r->request_duration_microseconds() method,
and a couple of utility methods.

Available from http://www.adelton.com/perl/Apache2-RequestRec-Time/
and from your favorite CPAN site in the authors/id/JANPAZ/ directory.
